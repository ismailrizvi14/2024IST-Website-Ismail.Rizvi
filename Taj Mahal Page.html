        <p style="font-family: Verdana">The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses 
	nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. 
	It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 
	1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, 
	the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. 
	The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting 
	the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, 
	calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the 
	Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal. Resting in the middle 
	of a wide plinth 23 feet (7 metres) high, the mausoleum proper is of white marble that reflects hues 
	according to the intensity of sunlight or moonlight. It has four nearly identical facades, each with
	a wide central arch rising to 108 feet (33 metres) at its apex and chamfered (slanted) corners 
	incorporating smaller arches. The majestic central dome, which reaches a height of 240 feet (73 metres) 
	at the tip of its finial, is surrounded by four lesser domes. The acoustics inside the main dome cause 
	the single note of a flute to reverberate five times. The interior of the mausoleum is organized around
	an octagonal marble chamber ornamented with low-relief carvings and semiprecious stones (pietra dura). 
	Therein are the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahān. Those false tombs are enclosed by a finely 
	wrought filigree marble screen. Beneath the tombs, at garden level, lie the true sarcophagi. Standing 
	gracefully apart from the central building, at each of the four corners of the square plinth, are elegant 
	minarets.</p>
