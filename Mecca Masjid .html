        <p style="font-family: Verdana">Makkah Masjid or Mecca Masjid, is a congregational mosque in Hyderabad, India. It is 
		one of the largest mosques in India with a capacity of 10,000 people. The mosque
		was built during the 17th century, and is a state-protected monument. It serves 
		as the primary mosque for the Old City of Hyderabad, and is located close to the
		historic landmarks of Charminar, Chowmahalla Palace and Laad Bazaar. Muhammad 
		Qutb Shah, the sixth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, commissioned bricks to be 
		made from the soil brought from Mecca, the holiest site of Islam, and used them 
		in the construction of the central arch of the mosque, thus giving the mosque 
		its name. The complex was put by UNESCO on its "tentative list" to become a 
		World Heritage Site in 2014, with others in the region, under the name 
		Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number of 
		different sultanates). The Mecca Masjid is considered to be one of the best 
		architectural works of the Qutb Shahis.[9] It is constructed entirely of 
		dressed stone, rather than rubble or plaster. The mosque's prayer hall measures 
		225 feet (69 m) by 180 feet (55 m), and has a 75 feet (23 m) high ceiling. The
		facade of the prayer hall features five open arches, and is flanked by two 
		minarets. Each minaret is topped by a dome, and adjoined to an arcaded balcony 
		lining either side of the prayer hall. The sahn (courtyard) of the mosque 
		measures 108 square metres. It contains a sundial, as well as the remains 
		of a hammam. Two minarets lie on either side of the main entrance to the mosque 
		complex. Towards the southern end of the mosque lie the marble tombs of the 
		Asaf Jahi rulers and family members, save the first (Asaf Jah I) and the last 
		(Asaf Jah VII).</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 30px" style="font-family: Times New Roman">Why visit Mecca Masjid?</h2>
        <p style="font-family: Verdana">As you already know, Mecca Masjid is one of the best architectural 
		marvels that the country has. During your visit here, you shouldn’t miss certain things which are listed below: 
Beautifully Designed Arches: Don’t miss the 15 intricately designed arches during your visit to the Mecca Masjid. 5 of these arches are built on the three different walls here.
Belgian Crystal Chandeliers: Ask anyone who has visited the Mecca Masjid. They will tell you how beautifully the mosque ceilings have been adorned with Belgian crystal chandeliers. Mecca Masjid is also home to ancient relics and artifacts which are kept inside a room located in the courtyard. What you will also find amazing here are the five passageways and tombs which are believed to have belonged to the Asif Jahi dynasty.
High Blocking Wall for Mehrab: The mosque also decorates itself with a high blocking wall which is located on the western side for Mehrab. This part is also home to two huge octagonal columns which are believed to have been created from a single granite piece. This wall has an arched gallery along with a dome on it.
The Sacred Relic: Mecca Masjid is also believed to be home to a sacred relic of the Prophet. According to a popular story, Sultan Muhammad Qutub Shah invited religious elders in the entire city and laid the foundation himself when none came forward. This holy mosque attracts Muslim worshippers from different parts of the country.
Carved Verses of Quran: You will find different verses of the Quran carved on both doors as well as arches. The mosque also adorns itself with cornices and floral motifs which reflect different aspects of Mecca Masjid. The design of the arches is quite similar to those at the Charminar and the Golconda Fort.</p>
