        <p style="font-size: 22px" style="font-family: Verdana">Mysore Palace, also called Mysuru Palace, or 
		Amba Vilas, a sprawling three-story, gray granite, Indo-Saracenic building capped by 
		a five-story tower that culminates in a gilded dome in the southern Indian city of 
		Mysuru in Karnataka state. The city is home to a number of palaces, but when people 
		talk of Mysore Palace, they are referring to this palace within a historic fort. 
		Also referred to as the Amba Vilas. the site features cows grazing happily among 
		the lush gardens and twelve Hindu temples that also make up the complex. The site’s 
		history is closely linked to that of the royal family of the former kingdom of 
		Mysore, the Wadiyar dynasty. The family ruled the area from 1399, when they first 
		lived in a palace at Mysore, and the city became the kingdom’s capital in 1799. While
		it is believed that the palace originally was built no later than 1574, the first 
		recorded mention of a palace on the current site was in 1638. In 1793 Tippu Sultan 
		is said to have knocked down the palace to make way for the new city of Nazarbad, 
		and a new wooden structure was built in 1803. This palace, however, was burned to 
		the ground in 1897 when a fire broke out during wedding festivities. The then queen 
		regent commissioned British-Indian architect Henry Irwin to design a new palace, and
		work on the present palace was completed in 1912. After India’s independence in 1947,
		the palace came into state ownership, although part has been given over to the 
		descendants of the former maharajas.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 30px" style="font-family: Times New Roman">Why visit Mysore Palace?</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 22px" style="font-family: Verdana">A picture of perfect symmetry, the Mysore Palace is 
		an instance of the heights attained by Indian architecture. Also known as the Amba 
		Vilas Palace, it is one of the most popular places to visit in the city of Mysore. 
		This monument has gone through many changes since its initial construction. It was 
		built several times during the rule of the royal family, the Maharajas of Mysore 
		(the Wodeyars), but was destroyed several times over the centuries. The present 
		palace was completed in 1912 and was built by the British architect, Henry Irwin. 
		It is the official residence of the Wodeyar or Wadiyar dynasty and attracts upwards 
		of 6 million visitors annually. The best time to visit is Around October when the 
		Palace is all lit up for the Dussehra celebrations is a great time to visit. The 
		age-old tradition of the Dasara festival is celebrated at Mysore Palace even to 
		this day. Mysore Dasara is one of the most famous festivals in Karnataka which even 
		attracts a global audience. When you go there you can climb the stairs of Chamundi
		Hill, explore Devraja Market, visit the rail museum, and see why the Gokulam’s Yoga
		schools are known all over the world. The palace can already be spotted from the
		distance regardless of which one of the four cardinal points you approach it from. 
		The four arched gates give way to a large garden area which surrounds the palace.
		The main building is three-storeys, made of stone granite, pink marble domes and a 
		five storey tower with a gilded dome and faces the East gate which is the one used 
		by VIP guests during the Dasara celebrations, south India’s most famous festivity 
		which celebrates the victory of good over evil.</p>
