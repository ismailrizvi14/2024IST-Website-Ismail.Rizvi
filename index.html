<h3> 1. Taj Mahal </h3> 
<img src="..." /> 
<hr/>    
<p> The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor’s court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.
The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative. Visiting the Taj Mahal complex in India enables you to connect with a piece of ancient history in real life. Being there in person is a much more powerful experience compared to seeing pictures online or reading about it in a book.
You can explore the Taj Mahal on your own, although it is advised to get a guided tour which may take 2-3 hours. In that way, you will be able to dive deeper into the history behind the Taj Mahal and be immersed in its atmosphere.
The Taj Mahal continues to stand as a symbol of true and eternal love, even though it was built so many years ago for one emperor’s late wife. If you are travelling through India, the Taj Mahal is a must-see building to connect deeper to a more spiritual side of what may appear as just a famous, ancient, and popular tourist attraction. The Taj Mahal is 73 m tall and is located on a 7m plinth. The main feature of the Taj Mahal is the large, gorgeous dome which is 17.7m in diameter and 24.4m in height. It is covered by a brass finial with a crescent moon motif where the ends of the moon are horns facing upwards, pointing upwards to heaven.
Four smaller domes surround the mausoleum and four minarets are located at the four corners of the Taj Mahal complex.
The buildings and garden are constructed so it is all symmetrical. The main gateway has quotes from the Quran written in Arabic calligraphy above the doorway by etching black stone into the white marble. You will notice eleven small domes above the entrance on the gateway as well as on the other side.
The mosque is located on the western side of the complex and faces the holy city of Mecca. The mosque is used solely for prayer purposes. On the eastern side, there is the guest house, which brings balance and harmony to the whole Taj Mahal complex.
