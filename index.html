<h3> 1. Taj Mahal </h3> 
<img src="..." /> 
<hr/>    
<p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor’s court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.
Visiting the Taj Mahal complex in India enables you to connect with a piece of ancient history in real life. Being there in person is a much more powerful experience compared to seeing pictures online or reading about it in a book.
You can explore the Taj Mahal on your own, although it is advised to get a guided tour which may take 2-3 hours. In that way, you will be able to dive deeper into the history behind the Taj Mahal and be immersed in its atmosphere.
The Taj Mahal continues to stand as a symbol of true and eternal love, even though it was built so many years ago for one emperor’s late wife. If you are travelling through India, the Taj Mahal is a must-see building to connect deeper to a more spiritual side of what may appear as just a famous, ancient, and popular tourist attraction. The Taj Mahal is 73 m tall and is located on a 7m plinth. The main feature of the Taj Mahal is the large, gorgeous dome which is 17.7m in diameter and 24.4m in height. It is covered by a brass finial with a crescent moon motif where the ends of the moon are horns facing upwards, pointing upwards to heaven.
Four smaller domes surround the mausoleum and four minarets are located at the four corners of the Taj Mahal complex.<p> 
<h2> 2. Red Fort </h2> 
<img src="..." />
<hr/>
<p>The Red Fort is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. 
Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. 
The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex. The fort's structure includes two gates, pavilions, turrets, bastions, and elements of garden design. Other important buildings housed by the Red Fort are Diwan-e-Khas and Diwan-e-Aam. You must visit this monument to experience its beauty. Multiple buildings are present inside the Red Fort. Several closed basements and rooms are present in the fort. No entry is allowed in these rooms. The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan used to keep his prisoners in these rooms. A high wall was built to prevent the enemies from coming inside the Red Fort. Meena Bazaar market is located inside the Red Fort. The carvings popular in the Red Fort can be found here in the market. The Indian Army started staying in the Red Fort after the British people. Other than Meena Bazar, you can visit Jama Masjid after visiting the Red Fort, which is at a distance of a few minutes.
Red Fort’s Light and Sound Show is renowned among its visitors and is one of the tourist attractions. People from different places come to enjoy the performance inside the Fort ground. It is a one-hour light and sound show that is conducted every evening except Mondays. The programmes are broadcasted in Hindi as well as English. If you are unaware of the fort’s history or are keen to find out new interesting information about the Red Fort, this light and sound show will give you a detailed account of the fort!<p>
