        <h2>What is the Red Fort?</h2>
        <p>The Red Fort is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that 
	historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan 
	commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638, when he decided to shift 
	his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect 
	Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal 
	architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
	The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire 
	in 1739. The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort
	Complex. The fort's structure includes two gates, pavilions, turrets, bastions, and elements of 
	garden design. Other important buildings housed by the Red Fort are Diwan-e-Khas and Diwan-e-Aam. 
	You must visit this monument to experience its beauty. Multiple buildings are present inside the Red
	Fort. Several closed basements and rooms are present in the fort. No entry is allowed in these rooms.
	The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan used to keep his prisoners in these rooms. A high wall was built to 
	prevent the enemies from coming inside the Red Fort. Meena Bazaar market is located inside the Red 
	Fort. The carvings popular in the Red Fort can be found here in the market. The Indian Army started 
	staying in the Red Fort after the British people.</p>
