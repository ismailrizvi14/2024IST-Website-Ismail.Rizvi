        <p style="font-family: Verdana">The Red Fort is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that 
	historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan 
	commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638, when he decided to shift 
	his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect 
	Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal 
	architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
	The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire 
	in 1739. The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort
	Complex. The fort's structure includes two gates, pavilions, turrets, bastions, and elements of 
	garden design. Other important buildings housed by the Red Fort are Diwan-e-Khas and Diwan-e-Aam. 
	You must visit this monument to experience its beauty. Multiple buildings are present inside the Red
	Fort. Several closed basements and rooms are present in the fort. No entry is allowed in these rooms.
	The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan used to keep his prisoners in these rooms. A high wall was built to 
	prevent the enemies from coming inside the Red Fort. Meena Bazaar market is located inside the Red 
	Fort. The carvings popular in the Red Fort can be found here in the market. The Indian Army started 
	staying in the Red Fort after the British people.</p>

<p style="font-family: Verdana">The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan,
    was brought to a new level of refinement. There is also a very small museum inside. A little average considering 
	some of the other sites Delhi has to offer but Red Fort is definitely worth visiting once. Other than
	Meena Bazar, you can visit Jama Masjid after visiting the Red Fort, which is at a distance of a few 
	minutes. Red Fort’s Light and Sound Show is renowned among its visitors and is one of the tourist attractions. People from different 
	places come to enjoy the performance inside the Fort ground. It is a one-hour light and sound show
	that is conducted every evening except Mondays. The programmes are broadcasted in Hindi as well as 
	English. If you are unaware of the fort’s history or are keen to find out new interesting 
	information about the Red Fort, this light and sound show will give you a detailed account 
	of the fort! The winter months of November to March are recommended the most when 
	it comes to visit the Red Fort in Delhi. These months are cooler and you will be saved from Delhi’s
	heat during this time.If you are looking for a pocket-friendly trip to Delhi, then you can visit in 
	the months of April and May but make sure to protect yourself from the heat waves in Delhi.</p>
