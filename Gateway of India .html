        <p style="font-family: Verdana">Gateway of India, monument in Mumbai that was completed in 1924.
		Situated on the Apollo Bunder overlooking the Arabian Sea, the Gateway of India was designed to 
		commemorate the visit in 1911 of King George V and Queen Mary, who had been en route to the 
		durbar being held in Delhi to celebrate their coronation as emperor and empress of India. The 
		Gateway of India’s foundation stone was laid on March 31, 1913, by the governor of Bombay, Sir 
		George Sydenham Clarke, with architect George Wittet’s designs finally being approved in August 
		1914. Between 1915 and 1919 a stretch of land along the harbor front was reclaimed from the sea,
		and it was here that the gateway and a new sea wall were built. The foundations were completed 
		the following year and construction was finished in 1924. Built of honey-colored basalt, the 
		Gateway of India resembles a conventional triumphal arch in concept, but architecturally it is
		Indo-Saracenic in style, modeled on 16th-century Gujarati work. This absorption of Mughal
		influences was consciously done, with a view to suggesting the link with earlier rulers and
		thus arguing for the legitimacy of British colonial rule. Intricate latticework decorates the
		walls, and four turrets surround an imposing central dome that is 50 feet (15 m) in diameter 
		and rises to 85 feet (26 m) high. Side chambers and halls were added to accommodate civic
		receptions. The building was opened to the public on December 4, 1924, by the viceroy of India,
		Rufus Isaacs, earl of Reading. Within a generation, this grand symbol of empire also became an 
		epitaph: the last British regiment to leave India after the country’s independence in 1947, the
		First Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry, passed through the Gateway of India before 
		setting sail for England on February 28, 1948. Today the gateway is one of India’s most popular 
		tourist sites.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Verdana">The monument in Mumbai is 16 meters high and was renovated as a 
		landing place for British Governors and other important people. The Gateway of India also served
		as an entry point to India. This is one of the most popular attractions in Mumbai and India; 
		many tourists, vendors, and photographers are found around this monument. The famous Elephanta 
		Festival of Music and Dance is celebrated at the Gateway of India. The festival’s former venue 
		was in Elephanta Caves, but as the number of visitors increased, it had to be shifted to a more 
		prominent place. There are long boat rides available to the Elephanta Caves. They are a group of
		7 caves with religious carvings. The boat ride begins from the Gateway of India, passes through
		Elephanta Caves, and returns to the starting point. The scenic beauty of the sea is 
		unparalleled, as witnessed on a cruise. People hire a luxury cruise to celebrate their 
		special occasions as well. There are so many things you can do at the Annual Festival of Sails 
		Regatta. This is a significant event at the Gateway of India. During the event, numerous sailboat
		races are held. Different programs are designed for kids from 8 to 16 years of age. Sailing is also 
		taught at the annual Regatta. The landmarks of Mumbai get lit up on different occasions. 
		Fireworks, lasers, and cultural programs are organized during the new year. Also, on December 4,
		a Beating Retreat ceremony is held annually to celebrate Indian Navy Day. The Navy's Western 
		Command performs fantastic drills during the event. A lot of fun and enthusiasm can be observed 
		on the day. In addition, Independence Day and many other Indian festivals are celebrated here.
		Visitors can come to the monument at 7:00 AM. The Gateway of India closes at 5:00 PM. The 
		perfect time to visit the memorial is early morning or late evening to see sunrise and sunset. 
		Visitors can enter the premises free of charge.</p>
