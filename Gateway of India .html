        <p style="font-family: Verdana">Gateway of India, monument in Mumbai that was completed in 1924.
		Situated on the Apollo Bunder overlooking the Arabian Sea, the Gateway of India was designed to 
		commemorate the visit in 1911 of King George V and Queen Mary, who had been en route to the 
		durbar being held in Delhi to celebrate their coronation as emperor and empress of India. The 
		Gateway of India’s foundation stone was laid on March 31, 1913, by the governor of Bombay, Sir 
		George Sydenham Clarke, with architect George Wittet’s designs finally being approved in August 
		1914. Between 1915 and 1919 a stretch of land along the harbor front was reclaimed from the sea,
		and it was here that the gateway and a new sea wall were built. The foundations were completed 
		the following year and construction was finished in 1924. Built of honey-colored basalt, the 
		Gateway of India resembles a conventional triumphal arch in concept, but architecturally it is
		Indo-Saracenic in style, modeled on 16th-century Gujarati work. This absorption of Mughal
		influences was consciously done, with a view to suggesting the link with earlier rulers and
		thus arguing for the legitimacy of British colonial rule. Intricate latticework decorates the
		walls, and four turrets surround an imposing central dome that is 50 feet (15 m) in diameter 
		and rises to 85 feet (26 m) high. Side chambers and halls were added to accommodate civic
		receptions. The building was opened to the public on December 4, 1924, by the viceroy of India,
		Rufus Isaacs, earl of Reading.</p>
